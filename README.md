# Team Development Standards & Best Practices

Welcome to the **Team Development Standards & Best Practices** repository. This document outlines the conventions, workflows, and best practices for our team when working with different tools and languages. Our goal is to promote consistency, maintainability, and efficiency in our projects.

## 0Ô∏è‚É£ General Guidelines

In this convention, each developer will be identified by an alias. The alias consists of two characters following the pattern `[a-z][a-z0-9]`. 

For example, the developer `John Doe` might choose the alias `jd`, while `Harry Houdini` could select `h2`.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Git Workflow & Version Control

### About the `main` Branch

The `main` branch is the default branch for all repositories and should always contain the *latest stable* version of the project. 

If you are the sole developer on a project, you may use the `main` branch for development. However, if multiple developers are collaborating, it is recommended to create separate branches for each feature or bug fix. Developers are encouraged **not** to push directly to the `main` branch but instead create a new branch and submit a pull request. If you are working in a team, communicate with the administrator before merging into the `main` branch.

### Branch Naming Conventions

#### From the `main` Branch

Branches created from the `main` branch should follow this naming convention:


```
<alias>-<feature-name>
```

For example, if developer `John Doe` is working on a feature to add a new login page, the branch name should be:

```
jd-login_page
```


If `<feature-name>` consists of multiple words, use underscores `_` to separate them.

#### From Other Branches

If you are creating a branch from another branch, use the following naming convention:



```
<previous-branch-name>-<alias>-<feature-name>
```

Continuing with the previous example, if `Harry Houdini` wants to add an animation to the login page, the branch name should be:


```
jd-login_page-h2-animation
```

This naming pattern should be followed recursively. That means if another developer wants to add a new feature to `Harry Houdini`'s branch, the branch name should be:

```
jd-login_page-h2-animation-<alias>-<feature-name>
```
